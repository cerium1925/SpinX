EPR sim package

Currently, I'm taking the initiative to learn EPR. My plan is to revamp an EPR program. This isn't just to solidify my own understanding, but also to contribute to the ongoing maintenance and future development of other EPR programs, or even to lay the groundwork for my own EPR projects, and to ensure continuity in the field of EPR simulation.
